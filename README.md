## Project setup

    npm install

Download and install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Then run the migrations: `npm run migrate`

ERP-RPG API uses _URI Versioning_, any request to a resource should be performed under `/api/v{vesrion-number}/` path, for example: `/api/v1/users/`. By default, the path `/api/` stands for the latest version. For now, there is only version 1.

Add an `.env` file to the root of the project with the following content:

```Shell
# Postgres DB
# May vary, depending on the configuration chosen on the previous step

# Local development
DATABASE_URI='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432'

```

## Seeding [WIP]

Now you have to setup your data manually, but in the future the following command will be available:

    npm run seed

## Running the project locally

```Shell
npm start

# Start development server with recompile option after detecting changes
npm run start-dev
```

## Accessing the API

This API uses _URI Versioning_, any request to a resource should be performed under `/api/v{vesrion-number}/` path, for example: `/api/v1/users/`. By default, the path `/api/` stands for the latest version. For now, there is only version 1, so accessing `/api/` should be the same as accessing `/api/v1/`.
