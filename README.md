## Project setup

    npm install

Setup MongoDB Server, follow these steps: https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodThis API uses _URI Versioning_, any request to a resource should be performed under `/api/v{vesrion-number}/` path, for example: `/api/v1/users/`. By default, the path `/api/` stands for the latest version. For now, there is only version 1.b-native#start-a-mongodb-server

Add an `.env` file to the root of the project with the following content:

```Shell
# Mongo DB
# May vary, depending on the configuration chosen on the previous step

# Local development
MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost/erp-rpg'

# Port
PORT=27017
```

## Seeding [WIP]

Open a terminal execute `mongo` command, then run the following:

    use erp-rpg
    db.users.insert({"nickname" : "admin"})

## Running the project locally

```Shell
npm start

# Start development server with recompile option after detecting changes
npm run start-dev
```

## Accessing the API

This API uses _URI Versioning_, any request to a resource should be performed under `/api/v{vesrion-number}/` path, for example: `/api/v1/users/`. By default, the path `/api/` stands for the latest version. For now, there is only version 1, so accessing `/api/` should be the same as accessing `/api/v1/`.
